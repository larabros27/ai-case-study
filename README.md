# DELL TECHNOLOGIES OFFERING MANAGED SERVICES AS A SERVICE

## Overview and Origin

* __Name of company:__

Dell Technologies

* __When was the company incorporated?__

In 1984 Michael Dell founded his company PC's Limited with $1000 while he was a college student at the University of Texas.

Dell has undergone many different transformations, but through their existence, Dell has been able to stay up to date with the latest trends in technology from cutomized PC sales, cloud computing and storage, to edge computing and now to artificial intelligence.

Dell introduced it's first wave of their AI PCs in March 2024 and introduced its Chief AI Officer at Dell Technologies, Jeff Boudreau, in June 2024. However, Dell has been incorporating AI technology into its operations and processes by focusing on providing the necessary computing infrastructure to support AI for its customers, allowing Dell to position itself as a key provider of hardware like high-performance servers and workstations specifically designed for AI workloads, while also developing software and partnerships to enable calculated and measured AI deployment for its customers.

* __Who are the founders of the company?__

Michael Dell is the funder of Dell Technologies.

* __How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?__

According to the website achievement.org, Michael Dell was fascinated by both business and electronics from an early age. Michael Dell was driven. So much so, that he applied to take a high school equivalency exam at age eight in hopes of getting out of school and into the business world faster. He invested in stock and precious metals using money he earned working part-time jobs. When he was 15, he bought himself one of the first Apple computers and disassembled it right away to see if he could put it back together.

During his first year at the University of Texas, Michael Dell started selling computer disk drives out of his dorm room. The only option for personal users to buy computer gear at the time was from retail stores, and the parts were not customizable before they were purchased. Dell purchased unsold IBM PCs from the retailers at cost, and would customize them by adding additional memory and disk drives and would sell them for 15% below retail price. 

Since then, Dell Technologies has been at the forefront of the tech industry. From storage to computing, Dell is among the leaders in the industry. Dell has continued to stay at the head of the industry and recently shifted focus to AI. Dell is once again ensuring that they are leaders in the shift by offering its customers an entire portfolio of AI and AI supported products. From Generative AI solutions that will allow customers to generate content with a few prompts to the Dell AI Factory representing Dell's strategy for embracing and implementing AI, while ensuring successful and consistent deployment at any scale and any location, Dell is leveraging their position as the tech giants they are by moving into this highly explosive field. The Dell AI Factory encompasses three key towers needed to support their customers' needs: Infrastructure; Ecosystem; Services.



* __How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?__

Although Dell started out in the college dorm of its founder, it has grown into a multi-billion dollar company and leader in the tech world. for years, Dell has been at the forefront of new technologies and trends that benefit society and their customers. By way of their dominant position and through key partnerships, Dell has been able to solidify their foothold in a growing industry. This time it's Artificial Intelligence. 

## Business Activities

* __What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?__

We all know that AI is the way of the future. Everyone is using AI in one way or another. AI has become so prevalent in our lives that some of us might not even realize that we're interacting with a form of AI. Something as simple as using an application that suggests the best route someone should take when they are driving somewhere or even the option we get when writing a text and we receive suggestions to finish our sentences as we type. These are all examples of how we interact with AI on a day to day basis.

A common obstacle for a lot people implementing new things in their lives is the unknown. Often time, people don't take the steps they need to take to be successful at something because they don't really know what they want to achieve, or if they do know what they would like to achieve, they don't know how to get there. This can lead to a delay in getting started because they don't know where to start or what step they need to take first. The same can be said for implementing AI into their lives. How many people know what capabilities AI has that they could use in their day to day lives? And if they do have an idea of how AI could help them in their daily lives, most people don't know how to take that first, crucial step.

Most businesses fall into the second scenario. Many businesses know that they would benefit from incorporating some form of AI into their current environments, whether it be applying machine learning on a factory floor to increase productivity or perhaps creating a self-help chat bot for their customers to be able to have answers to common situations or scenarios they might be facing. If the business owner does not know what is available or where to start, they may be hesitant to take that step and to incorporate the tools that are available to them. But more likely, the business owner knows what they would like to achieve, but don't know whether or not AI can help them achieve that goal. If they do know that that AI can help them achieve that goal, they still might be lost in knowing where to start. Without knowing what step to take first, they could be hesitant to even explore the possibility of utilizing AI to enhance their business, because as the famous Greek philosopher, Socrates said, "You don't know what you don't know."

That is one piece of the AI market that Dell is looking to capture. It's called Professional Services for AI. This is a product that is being pushed to Dell's customers as a managed services contract. This allows Dell to help those customers who, like described above, know they could use an AI solution to help them, but like so many people, they don't know where to start or what is available for them. Dell takes the question out of it for them. Dell will help their customer build a solid AI strategy by establishing an actionable plan to align priorities and set a clear path forward. Part of the strategy Dell offers as part of their AI strategy is the ability for their AI professionals to prepare and validate data for GenAI models for impactful and meaningful outputs to their customers. They help implement a robust GenAI platform primed for innovation with their customers' priority use cases. They help to deploy & test GenAI models with seamless integration and peak performance. The also look to help their customers operate & scale GenAI solutions, expand capabilities, and streamline operations.

Dell creates a roadmap for their customers that will help them achieve their objectives by utilizing their GenAI resources as effectively as possible.

According to Forbes in an article written n Octobe 2023 titled 10 Hurdles Companies Are Facing When Implementing AI (And How To Overcome Them), the author states that the lack of "in-house expertise" is the number one blocker for companies when it comes to implementing an effective AI strategy. The author goes on to suggest that companies invest in training or to collaborate with others, or to hire AI experts. All of these are options, but they all come with their own challenges. If you make the decision to invest in training, you are facing a delay in your strategy while you wait for your resources to get trained and to have some hands on practice. You don't want someone who is brand new to the field to be pushing strategies and changes into your ecosystem without being sure that they are not going to break something or cause some irreparable damage to your business. While it would be good to have your team trained, they would still be new to the strategies and tools and would only be able to implement what they already know. The option of hiring AI experts comes down to whether or not you can afford to hire a new resource. You are also still dependent on them understanding your processes and your ecosystem. Given the added costs you would incur in hiring, training, and providing benefits to your new employee, you are now at the mercy of them staying with your company for the time you need them to. Collaborating with others is the least expensive option, but also the most risky option when it comes to ensuring your information is secure and that only your employees have it because you are inviting someone to look at the data you are sharing.

With the help of the Dell AI professionals, their customers do not have to worry about trying to learn how to implement an effective AI strategy, but rather focus on what the end results they wish to achieve are and allow Dell to drive the ship to success while they give direction and ensure they are meeting their goals as designed. This takes the guess work out of what is available to them and how to get started. Dell will do it for them and ensure that they are utilizing the latest AI tools and strategies and ensuring they are meeting industry best practices as that is what Dell aims to follow through their processes.




* __Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?__

The Professional Services for AI offering that Dell provides to their customers is intended for business of all sizes. Dell has customers of all sizes and given the expertise that Dell is offering, they would be able to scale to any customer size or need. From small mom and pop customers to large manufacturing corporations, Dell has found a way to cater to all of them. 

* __What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)__

One key advantage that Dell has over other companies is that it is also a big player in the infrastructure needed to implement the AI strategies most customers need or want. Dell's ability to not only offer the infrastructure their customer needs, but to offer the services to maintain that infrastructure puts Dell in a unique position that has helped them to solidify their position as a leader in the AI industry.

Dell received a huge boost through a stamp of approval given to them by the Chief Executive of NVIDIA, Jensen Huang, at the GTC conference when he mentioned Dell as the best end-to-end technology infrastructure player. This was a remarkable moment for Dell that gave the company momentum in the AI realm as it received the stamp of approval from the leading chip manufacturer.


* __Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)__

From a hardware technology perspective, Dell has made adjustments to the equipment in order to be able to support AI functionality. For example, the computing needs of AI require more power. Due to this increase demand in power, Dell has also adjusted the number of GPUs that are housed within a single rack. With an increase of power requirements and adjustments made to the number of GPUs that each rack holds, Dell has had to also rethink their cooling solutions for these racks. 

From a software perspective, Dell has packaged all of the tools that a business would need to support AI operations into their Enterprise Tools-as-a-service to be able to integrate to their customer's environments while being able to guide their customers according to industry best practice and trying to standardize the support model as much as possible to make it a repeatable and sustainable model.

Some of the AI offerings included in Dell's Professional Services for AI offers include: LLM Serving; AI Data-as-a-service; Intent Deterction & Orchestration; ML Ops; Service agent to agent architecture; Platform Services; Low-Code/No-Code Chat & Agent Builder.  

## Landscape

* __What field is the company in?__

Dell Technologies is among the leaders in the Tech industry. They have been at the forefront of the industry by way of their PC sales; server sales; edge computing, and now AI.

* __What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5-10 years?__

One of the major trends that arose over the past 5-10 years in the Tech industry is cloud computing and storage. This allows companies to reduce their operating costs by not having to incur added expenses to maintain their own hardware.

Managed Services became much more prevalent in the field as well due to the movement of customers' environments into could environments. The Managed Services option has allowed the customers to focus less on maintaining their own environments and focus on what they do best. A great example of this would be a manufacturing company. While the company has many employees, they are able to staff a small number of IT specialists as points of contacts for Dell's Managed Services resources. This allows the company to focus on the manufacturing side of the house, while tapping into the IT expertise that Dell brings to the table. By using this module, the customer would have access to the latest in innovations that are being implemented at Dell. 

* __What are the other major companies in this field?__

There are quite a few tech companies that are getting into offering AI as a Service field including some common names like: Google; BigML; IBM Watson; AWS AI. There aren't as many companies that are offering Managed AI services, which really give Dell a unique advantage of being able to not only offer the infrastructure and the support that comes with it, but also the option to maintain and optimize their customers' data and processes to support their intended outcomes.

One of the companies that is also offering Managed Services for AI is called Provectus. It offers its customers end-to-end, white glove Managed AI services. They have a team of experienced DevOps, Data Science, Machine Learning and Data Engineering professionals to help their customers' businesses meeting their AI needs. It's not entirely clear how Provectus solves the hardware issue, but it appears that they would require their customer to migrate into a supported environment that is already housed and supported by Provectus, which might give businesses a reason to pause due to the sensitivity that some of their data might have. Many customers are hesitant when turning over the keys to the kingdom, but given Dell's large market strength and reputable experience, it should be less likely that the companies are as hesitant if it were Dell. Another reason for hesitating would be that Provectus uses Amazon to host it's data, something that Dell doesn't  have to rely on.


## Results

* __What has been the business impact of this company so far?__

The offering is still quite new, but the business impact to Dell so far has been a shift of personnel and skills needed to support the offering. Dell has invested in continued education and certifications for some of their managed services resources to learn and become experts in AI.

The effect has also made its way down to the sales forces that support Dell. They have shifted to having a larger focus on selling hardware and services that support AI which was evident in Dell's revenue reporting for the second quarter of the fiscal year. Dell saw their revenue soar to $25 billion in that quarter alone.

* __What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?__

Most companies use customer satisfaction ratings to measure success in this area. While these are a huge help to companies to see how satisfied their customers are with their services, they can be very subjective. That's because these are typically surveys that the customer takes measuring their satisfaction with the services they are being provided. The limitations to the accuracy or legitimacy of the survey depends on the individual's perception of how the service was provided and typically not based on hard data. For example, you can have an end user who has been very frustrated with the company as a whole and not necessarily with the process they are providing a survey for, which could skew the way they answer the questions pertaining to that specific survey just based off past experiences they have had with the company.

Other common forms of measurement that companies use to measure success are the user adoption rates and the engagement metrics. Both of these are less subjective forms of measuring success because they rely on data as opposed to someone's feelings, but they still only paint part of the picture. A customer can have a high adoption rate due to their company making the adoption of the tool a requirement, but the end users could be totally disappointed with the way the service is being delivered. Or the customer could have a very high engagement rate, but those engagements might not all be positive. In fact, those engagements could be an engagement that is stemming from  problem an end user might be having and those would to lean towards the negative.

Dell does not publicly share their CSAT scores or engagement metrics for their AI as a service offering, but they have reported a high overall customer satisfaction rate for their support and deployment services, which often exceeds 90%, indicating that their customers are having a positive experience with their AI offerings.

* __How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?__

Due to the nature of Dell not sharing their CSAT scores or engagement metrics, it is difficult to say exactly how they are doing in comparison to other companies. However, it has become widely known that Dell's NativeEdge platform will automate the delivery of NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, which not only solidifies Dell's partnership with NVIDIA, but also allows developers and IT operators easily deploy AI applications and solutions at the edge. This focus on end-user experience should translate to Dell and NVIDIA continuing to be leaders in the AI space and more specifically in the Managed Services for AI space.

Dell's key partnership with NVIDIA allows them to provide the world’s industries with a full-stack offering — including computing, networking, storage, services and software — that drives copilots, coding assistants, virtual customer service agents. This is a key advantage that Dell has over most of it's competitors. 

Dell's stock price increase paints the picture of the optimism that not only the company has, but also it's share holders and the public in general. Dell's stock price has increased by over 200% since March 2023, which can largely be attributed to Dell's strategic shifts to support their customers looking to incorporate AI in their environments and processes. It seems the catalyst for the rally has been a deep belief in the company’s sales of AI servers, which employ Nvidia’s powerful graphics processing chips. 


## Recommendations

* __If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)__

If I were to be in a position to advise the company in the direction they should go, I would tell them to continue doing what they are doing now. I would continue to convert the managed services space to better align to the use of AI resources. I would provide continuous training to the Dell employees that currently support their customers in the best practices around the use of AI and provide use cases to all the existing customers to show the increase in productivity and cost saving measures they could gain by moving towards the new solution.

I would urge the sales force to focus on highlighting the hardware currently being upgraded to incorporate the chips and other pieces that help Dell enjoy the leverage they have over their competitors. The sales force would also have to receive training on AI solutions in order to intelligently speak to existing and prospective customers on how they can utilize AI if they are not already aware.

Naturally, the same sales force should package the managed services for AI with the hardware they sale. This should be the case for all sales for Dell hardware, whether it be new hardware or an upgrade to existing hardware. Dell should do everything it can to incentivize their customers to not only incorporate AI solutions, but also to allow Dell to manage those solutions for them.


* __Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?__

Dell is already offering these services. According to a publication in the Harvard Business Review, some companies are hesitant to adopt AI technologies out of fear of the unknown. Most that are not adopting AI are waiting for the technology to mature more and for AI experts and expertise to be more widely available. The strategy is referred to as being "fast followers", which has been used with other technologies and technology companies in the past, but likely won't work in this case due to the length of time it can take to implement the AI strategy and to incorporate the systems necessary into their existing systems and processes. Due to this, the author believes that late adopters will be too late and will likely have missed their opportunity compared to those early adopters who will have a head start. The early adopters will have a big advantage in data needed to run their AI systems and would have likely already mastered some of the engineering it takes to run these systems. Due to their head-start, the early adopters will also likely have taken a considerable market share and will enjoy doing so with substantially lower operating costs along with increase in performance.


* __What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?__

Dell's Managed Services for AI would likely utilize the high performing servers and workstations that are specifically designed to run AI services on them. By way of innovation, it's almost certain that Dell will come up with proprietary software that they run to help them streamline the new process they will have to incorporate in order to support their customers.


* __Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?__

Without the advantage that Dell has over its competitors of also being a preferred hardware provider, Dell would be in the same boat as many of the rest of the companies in the technology field. Offering the hardware needed to run most AI solutions and the services to maintain that hardware, Dell really focuses on the end-user experience by eliminating all the stress and questions that businesses typically have to deal with. It gives the companies the ability to focus on operations rather than maintenance. Much like the hardware offering, the Managed Services for AI offering takes the headaches and added expenses that would typically be associated rolling out a viable AI solution. They no longer have to come up with the answers and strategy, but rather explain the goal they would like to achieve and help validate that the AI expert that Dell offers them as part of their managed services offering is guiding them in the right direction.
